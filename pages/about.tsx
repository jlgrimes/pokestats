              Ultimately, this is going to be based off the honor system. Even
              the PokéStats team can accidentally misreport a deck. All
              information will be checked to the best of our ability. Procedures
              have yet to be set in stone for if anyone is intentionally
              spreading misinformation about deck archetypes repeatedly, but
              rest assured there will be some procedure.
